							<p>I worked on the MusicFlow web application, a web based audio editing suite for dynamic compositions. For this project we used CoffeScript, Backbone.js, Ruby on Rails, Capybara, Casper.js and many other technologies. The role saw me as part of a two-man team, working with <a href="http://www.ronenbarzel.org/">Ronen Barzel</a>. Working in such a small team meant a lot of room for autonomy and creativity. In addition to the composer tools I created a user-facing HTML5 video editor for arranging and previewing dynamic scores with video.</p>

							<h4>Programming</h4>

							<p>I began when I was very young, on a BBC Micro at around 5 years old. Programming has always been a passion of mine, it filled my childhood with immense joy, creativity and excitement at the seemingly endless possibilities. There has always been a desire to create virtual worlds, to create experiences that would touch the lives of others.</p>
						</li>
												
						<li>
							<h4>Mathematics</h4>

							<p>I've always gained enjoyment from solving mathematical problems and exploring new topics, among which are Analytical Geometry, Timeseries Analysis, Numerical Methods, Probability Theory and Statistics, Game Theory, Abstract Algebra and Topology. To me it is the mother of all sciences, a powerful language and tool.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<h4>Deep Learning</h4>

							<p>I've a huge passion for Artificial Neural Networks applied to computer vision and timeseries modelling. I've studied the work of Geoffrey Hinton and Yann Lecunn (among others) and have applied LSTMs and CNN in production applications. I make sure to keep up to date with the literature and am always learning.</p>
						</li>				

						<!--li>
							<h4>Web Development</h4>
						
							<p>I've had the fortune of working with great designers and developers. I've embarked on projects which require strong front and backend skills. I set a high quality bar and am thorough.</p>
						</li-->
					</ul>					
				</div>

				<div class="section projects">
					<h3>Projects</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>SampleRNN_torch</h4>
							<p>An unconditional neural generative model of raw audio implemented in the Torch framework, capable of modelling complex audio at the sample level. I've many future research plans involving conditional variants of this model applied in a variety of settings.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>VisionMachine</h4>

							<p>An LLVM powered, gesture driven, flow-based programming compiler and development environment. This project aims to circumvent the limitations of traditional compilers and programming languages, balancing creativity with optimal machine code generation, and the ability to hot-patch changes live several orders of magnitude faster than other solutions (Edit and Continue, Indefiant’s Recode). Currently in a prototypical phase future project aims include GPU acceleration via technologies such as KernelGen and Polly. With time this could be a strong competitor against products such as MaxMSP, PureData and LabView by supporting heterogeneous computing architectures transparently.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Near-Eye Lightfield Display</h4>

							<p>Recreating the VR glasses as described in Douglas Lanman's paper, Near-Eye Light Field Displays. This project is a great opportunity to get hands on experience with microlenses and microdisplays, solid state gyroscope and lightfield rendering. I have implemented rasterisation and path tracing lightfield renderers, using a combination of OpenGL and OpenCL. The next phase is to house the glasses and mount the solid-state motion tracker. Studying the paper was a good learning experience in the optics and mathematics involved.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Bitcoin Payment Processing System</h4>

							<p>With a custom fork of the bitcoin-core client, adding ZeroMQ support, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Node.js and custom frontend JavaScript users can deposit and withdraw funds via QR code - receiving realtime notifications via WebSocket. The IP for this project is held by my company CoinTech Ltd.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>F***ing Magnets Projector-Depthcam Calibration Software</h4>

							<p>Performs pose estimation between a depth camera and projector, creating an RGBD video feed as seen from the projector-eye-view. This has applications in interactive installations.</p>
